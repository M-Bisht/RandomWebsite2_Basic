            <p class="text-inner-2-section-2" id="p-3-inner-2-section-2">
              Growing up in a co-op in the heart of Portland, Oregon as the
              child of die-hard hippies, I have been surrounded by a steady
              stream of creative, free-thinkers my entire life. So, it came as
              no surprise to my mother (a dancer and singer) and father (a
              visual artist and musician) that I would embark on a career as a
              professional performer at the ripe age of 6.

            <h2 class="text-inner-2-section-2" id="h2-4-inner-2-section-2">
              the series
            </h2>
            <p class="text-inner-2-section-2" id="p-5-inner-2-section-2">
              After attending The Juilliard School as a US Presidential Scholar
              in Arts, I spent 20 years performing on Broadway, throughout the
              US, and around the world before settling down in Los Angeles. And
              it is here where the real work began: learning how to translate
              big, over-the-top musical theater training into real, raw acting
              fit for a screen. It was a humbling journey during which I have
              been blessed to train with some of the industry's best including
              Anita Jesse, Dee Wallace Stone, Laura Gardner, Gregory Berg
              Sobeck, and Amy Lyndon.

              the spin-off
            </h2>
            <p class="text-inner-2-section-2" id="p-7-inner-2-section-2">
              Then came a plot twist: I decided to take my years of professional
              dance experience and become a Master Pilates Trainer and certified
              yoga instructor. Helping people from ages 8 to 80 tune into their
              bodies and minds over the last 12 years has deepened my sense of
              self and my ability to be authentic.

              the sequel
            </h2>
            <p class="text-inner-2-section-2" id="p-9-inner-2-section-2">
              So, now I'm back to the original script — sharing the reality of
              the human experience through storytelling. Check out more about me
              below and let's see if we can create something awesome together.
